= Welcome to RegacyDB!

RegacyDB brings the power of legacy databases to Ruby on Rails 3.
This plugin is based on RBatis - the port of iBatis[http://ibatis.apache.org] to Ruby and Ruby on Rails.
While this plugin is currently operational, it requires serious refactoring, documentation and testing. Please, feel encouraged to contribute!

== Generating a model

You can generate a RegacyDB derived model using:

  rails generate rmodel model_name

It will generate an empty RegacyDB model in [app/models/model_name.rb] that looks something like:

  class ModelName < UnforgivenPL::RegacyDB::Base
  end
